# python_fizzbuzz_app

This is my fizzbuzz solution in python.
In this app it will take a number as input and check that number via several conditions. If the number can devide by 3 it will print fizz, if the number devide by 5 will peint buzz and if the number is dedided by both 3 and 5 it will print FizzBuzz.
In this file i used if statements, while loops
